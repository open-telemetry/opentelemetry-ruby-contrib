# Opentelemetry::Resource::Detectors::Container

The `opentelemetry-resourcedetector-container` gem provides a container resource detector for OpenTelemetry.

## What is OpenTelemetry?

OpenTelemetry is an open source observability framework, providing a general-purpose API, SDK, and related tools required for the instrumentation of cloud-native software, frameworks, and libraries.

OpenTelemetry provides a single set of APIs, libraries, agents, and collector services to capture distributed traces and metrics from your application. You can analyze them using Prometheus, Jaeger, and other observability tools.

## How does this gem fit in?

The `opentelemetry-resourcedetector-container` gem provides a means of retrieving a resource for supported environments following the resource semantic conventions.

## How do I get started?
