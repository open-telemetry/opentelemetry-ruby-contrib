# OpenTelemetry Puma Instrumentation

The OpenTelemetry Puma gem is a community maintained instrumentation for [Puma][puma-home]. It currently does not emit Puma telemetry and only registers hooks to ensure application telemetry is sent before the Puma process exits.

## How do I get started?

Install the gem using:

```console
gem install opentelemetry-instrumentation-puma
```

Or, if you use [bundler][bundler-home], include `opentelemetry-instrumentation-puma` in your `Gemfile`.

## Usage

To use the instrumentation, call `use` with the name of the instrumentation:

```ruby
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use 'OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::Puma'
end
```

Alternatively, you can also call `use_all` to install all the available instrumentation.

```ruby
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use_all
end
```

## How can I get involved?

The `opentelemetry-instrumentation-puma` gem source is [on github][repo-github], along with related gems including `opentelemetry-api` and `opentelemetry-sdk`.
