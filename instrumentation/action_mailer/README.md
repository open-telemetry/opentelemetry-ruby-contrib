# OpenTelemetry ActionMailer Instrumentation

The ActionMailer instrumentation is a community-maintained instrumentation for the ActionMailer portion of the [Ruby on Rails][rails-home] web-application framework.

## How do I get started?

Install the gem using:

```
gem install opentelemetry-instrumentation-action_mailer
gem install opentelemetry-instrumentation-rails
```

Or, if you use [bundler][bundler-home], include `opentelemetry-instrumentation-action_mailer` in your `Gemfile`.

## Usage

To use the instrumentation, call `use` with the name of the instrumentation:

```ruby
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use 'OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::Rails'
  c.use 'OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::ActionMailer'
end
```

Alternatively, you can also call `use_all` to install all the available instrumentation.

```ruby
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use_all
end
```

### Options

ActionMailer instrumentation doesn't expose email address by default, but if email address is needed, simply use `:email_address` option:
```ruby
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use 'OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::ActionMailer', { email_address: :include }
end
```

If only want to hide certain attributes from the notifications payload for email address:
```ruby
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use 'OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::ActionMailer', { email_address: :include, disallowed_notification_payload_keys: ['email.to.address'] }
end
```


## Active Support Instrumentation

This instrumentation now relies entirely on `ActiveSupport::Notifications` and registers a custom Subscriber that listens to relevant events to report as spans.

See the table below for details of what [Rails Framework Hook Events](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_support_instrumentation.html#action-mailer) are recorded by this instrumentation:

| Event Name | Creates Span? | Notes |
| - | - | - |
| `deliver.action_mailer` | :white_check_mark: | Creates an span with kind `internal` and email content and status|
| `process.action_mailer` | :x: | Lack of useful info so ignored |

## Semantic Conventions

Internal spans are named using the name of the `ActiveSupport` event that was provided (e.g. `action_mailer deliver`).

Attributes that are specific to this instrumentation are recorded under `action_mailer deliver`:

| Attribute Name | Type | Notes |
| - | - | - |
| `email.x_mailer` | String | Mailer class that is used to send mail |
| `email.message_id` | String | Set from Mail gem|
| `email.subject` | String | Mail subject |
| `email.to.address` | Array | Receiver for mails (omit by default, inlcude when `email_address` set to `:include`) |
| `email.from.address` | Array | Sender for mails (omit by default, inlcude when `email_address` set to `:include`) |
| `email.cc.address` | Array | mails CC (omit by default, inlcude when `email_address` set to `:include`) |
| `email.bcc.address` | Array | mails BCC (omit by default, inlcude when `email_address` set to `:include`)  |
