# Archived instrumentations

This directory contains instrumentations that are no longer maintained because
their upstream dependencies have reached end-of-life. The code remains
available for reference but is excluded from new releases.

- `ruby_kafka` – archived after the upstream `ruby-kafka` gem was deprecated.
