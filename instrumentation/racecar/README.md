# OpenTelemetry Racecar Instrumentation

The Racecar instrumentation is a community-maintained instrumentation for [Racecar](https://github.com/zendesk/racecar), a client library for Apache Kafka.


## How do I get started?

Install the gem using:

```
gem install opentelemetry-instrumentation-racecar
```

Or, if you use [bundler][bundler-home], include `opentelemetry-instrumentation-racecar` in your `Gemfile`.

##Â Runtime requirements

This instrumentation is built on top of Racecar's integration with `ActiveSupport::Notifications`. `ActiveSupport::Notification` will need to be loaded before the instrumentation is installed (as below) or the installation will cancel.

## Usage

To use the instrumentation, call `use` with the name of the instrumentation:

```ruby
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use 'OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::Racecar'
end
```

Alternatively, you can also call `use_all` to install all the available instrumentation.

```ruby
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use_all
end
```

## Examples

Example usage can be seen in the `./example` directory [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ruby-contrib/blob/main/instrumentation/racecar/example). Run `./trace_demonstration.sh` to see its behaviour.

## How can I get involved?
