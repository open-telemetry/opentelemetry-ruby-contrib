# OpenTelemetry Http Instrumentation

The HTTP instrumentation is a community-maintained instrumentation for the [HTTP][http-home] gem.

## How do I get started?

Install the gem using:

```console
gem install opentelemetry-instrumentation-http
```

Or, if you use [bundler][bundler-home], include `opentelemetry-instrumentation-http` in your `Gemfile`.

## Usage

To use the instrumentation, call `use` with the name of the instrumentation:

```ruby
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use 'OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::HTTP'
end
```

Alternatively, you can also call `use_all` to install all the available instrumentation.

```ruby
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use_all
end
```

## Enriching http span names

We surface a hook to easily rename your span.

The lambda accepts as arguments (request_method, request_path) and returns a string that is set as the span name.

```ruby
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use 'OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::Rack', { span_name_formatter: ->(request_method, request_path) { "HTTP #{request_method} #{request_path}" }
end
```

## Examples

Example usage can be seen in the `./example/trace_demonstration.rb` file [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ruby-contrib/blob/main/instrumentation/http/example/trace_demonstration.rb)
