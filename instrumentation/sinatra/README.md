# Sinatra Instrumentation

The Sinatra instrumentation is a community-maintained instrumentation for the [Sinatra][sinatra-home] Web Framework.

## How do I get started?

Install the gem using:

```console
gem install opentelemetry-instrumentation-sinatra
```

Or, if you use [bundler][bundler-home], include `opentelemetry-instrumentation-sinatra` to your `Gemfile`.

### Version Compatibility

Older versions of Sinatra depend on older version of Rack, which are not supported by the latest version of Rack instrumentation. If you are using an older version of Sinatra and need an earlier version of Rack instrumentation, then consider installing and pinning the compatible gem version, e.g.:

```console
gem opentelemetry-instrumentation-rack, "<version>"
```

| Sinatra Version | Rack Instrumentation Version |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `< 2.0`         | `= 0.22.1`                   |
| `>= 2.0`        | `~> 0.22`                    |

## Usage

To install the instrumentation, add the gem to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'opentelemetry-instrumentation-sinatra'
```

Then call `use` with the name of the instrumentation:

```ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'bundler/setup'

Bundler.require

OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use 'OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::Sinatra'
end
```

Alternatively, you can also call `use_all` to install all the available instrumentation.

```ruby
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use_all
end
```

## How can I get involved?

The `opentelemetry-instrumentation-sinatra` gem source is [on github][repo-github], along with related gems including `opentelemetry-api` and `opentelemetry-sdk`.

The OpenTelemetry Ruby gems are maintained by the OpenTelemetry Ruby special interest group (SIG). You can get involved by joining us on our [GitHub Discussions][discussions-url], [Slack Channel][slack-channel] or attending our weekly meeting.

## HTTP semantic convention stability

In the OpenTelemetry ecosystem, HTTP semantic conventions have now reached a stable state. However, the initial Rack instrumentation was introduced before this stability was achieved, which resulted in HTTP attributes being based on an older version of the semantic conventions. 

To facilitate the migration to stable semantic conventions, you can use the `OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN` environment variable. This variable allows you to opt-in to the new stable conventions, ensuring compatibility and future-proofing your instrumentation.

Sinatra instrumentation installs Rack middleware, but the middleware version it installs depends on which `OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN` environment variable is set.

When setting the value for `OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN`, you can specify which conventions you wish to adopt:

- `http` - Emits the stable HTTP and networking conventions and ceases emitting the old conventions previously emitted by the instrumentation.
- `http/dup` - Emits both the old and stable HTTP and networking conventions, enabling a phased rollout of the stable semantic conventions.
- Default behavior (in the absence of either value) is to continue emitting the old HTTP and networking conventions the instrumentation previously emitted.

During the transition from old to stable conventions, Rack instrumentation code comes in three patch versions: `dup`, `old`, and `stable`. These versions are identical except for the attributes they send. Any changes to Rack instrumentation should consider all three patches.

For additional information on migration, please refer to our [documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/non-normative/http-migration/).
