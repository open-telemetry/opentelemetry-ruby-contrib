# OpenTelemetry::Resource::Detector::AWS

The `opentelemetry-resource-detector-aws` gem provides an AWS resource detector for OpenTelemetry.

## What is OpenTelemetry?

OpenTelemetry is an open source observability framework, providing a general-purpose API, SDK, and related tools required for the instrumentation of cloud-native software, frameworks, and libraries.

OpenTelemetry provides a single set of APIs, libraries, agents, and collector services to capture distributed traces and metrics from your application. You can analyze them using Prometheus, Jaeger, and other observability tools.

## How does this gem fit in?

The `opentelemetry-resource-detector-aws` gem provides a means of retrieving a resource for supported environments following the resource semantic conventions. When running on AWS platforms, this detector automatically identifies and populates resource attributes with relevant metadata from the environment.

## Installation

Install the gem using:

```console
gem install opentelemetry-sdk
gem install opentelemetry-resource-detector-aws
```

Or, if you use Bundler, include `opentelemetry-sdk` and `opentelemetry-resource-detector-aws` in your `Gemfile`.

## Usage

```rb
require 'opentelemetry/sdk'
require 'opentelemetry/resource/detector'

OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  # Specify which AWS resource detectors to use
  c.resource = OpenTelemetry::Resource::Detector::AWS.detect([:ec2, :ecs, :eks, :lambda])

  # Or use just one detector
  c.resource = OpenTelemetry::Resource::Detector::AWS.detect([:ec2])
  c.resource = OpenTelemetry::Resource::Detector::AWS.detect([:ecs])
  c.resource = OpenTelemetry::Resource::Detector::AWS.detect([:eks])
  c.resource = OpenTelemetry::Resource::Detector::AWS.detect([:lambda])
end
```

## Supported AWS Platforms

### AWS EC2 Detector

<!-- cspell:ignore Fargate -->
Populates `cloud` and `host` for processes running on Amazon EC2, including abstractions such as ECS on EC2. Notably, it does not populate anything on AWS Fargate.

| Resource Attribute | Description |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| `cloud.account.id` | Value of `accountId` from `/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document` request |
| `cloud.availability_zone` | Value of `availabilityZone` from `/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document` request |
| `cloud.platform` | The cloud platform. In this context, it's always "aws_ec2" |
| `cloud.provider` | The cloud provider. In this context, it's always "aws" |
| `cloud.region` | Value of `region` from `/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document` request |
| `host.id` | Value of `instanceId` from `/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document` request |
| `host.name` | Value of hostname from `/latest/meta-data/hostname` request |
| `host.type` | Value of `instanceType` from `/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document` request |

### AWS ECS Detector

<!-- cspell:ignore launchtype awslogs -->
Populates `cloud`, `container`, and AWS ECS-specific attributes for processes running on Amazon ECS.
| Resource Attribute | Description |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| `cloud.platform` | The cloud platform. In this context, it's always "aws_ecs" |
| `cloud.provider` | The cloud provider. In this context, it's always "aws" |
| `container.id` | The container ID from the `/proc/self/cgroup` file |
| `container.name` | The hostname of the container |
| `aws.ecs.container.arn` | The hostname of the container |
| `aws.ecs.cluster.arn` | The ARN of the ECS cluster |
| `aws.ecs.launchtype` | The launch type for the ECS task (e.g., "fargate" or "ec2") |
| `aws.ecs.task.arn` | The ARN of the ECS task |
| `aws.log.group.names` | The CloudWatch log group names (if awslogs driver is used) |
| `aws.log.stream.names` | The CloudWatch log stream names (if awslogs driver is used) |
| `aws.log.stream.arns` | The CloudWatch log stream ARNs (if awslogs driver is used) |

### AWS EKS Detector

Populates `cloud`, `container`, and Kubernetes (k8s) attributes for processes running on Amazon EKS.
| Resource Attribute | Description |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| `cloud.platform` | The cloud platform. In this context, it's always "aws_eks" |
| `cloud.provider` | The cloud provider. In this context, it's always "aws" |
| `container.id` | The container ID from the `/proc/self/cgroup` file |
| `k8s.cluster.name` | The name of the EKS cluster from the `cluster-info` config map in the `amazon-cloudwatch` namespace |

The EKS detector verifies that the process is running on EKS by checking:
1. Presence of Kubernetes service account token and certificate
2. Ability to access the `aws-auth` config map in the `kube-system` namespace
3. Availability of either cluster name or container ID

### AWS Lambda Detector
Populates `cloud` and `faas` (Function as a Service) attributes for processes running on AWS Lambda.
| Resource Attribute | Description |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| `cloud.platform` | The cloud platform. In this context, it's always "aws_lambda" |
| `cloud.provider` | The cloud provider. In this context, it's always "aws" |
| `cloud.region` | The AWS region from the `AWS_REGION` environment variable |
| `faas.name` | The Lambda function name from the `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME` environment variable |
| `faas.version` | The Lambda function version from the `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_VERSION` environment variable |
| `faas.instance` | The Lambda function instance ID from the `AWS_LAMBDA_LOG_STREAM_NAME` environment variable |
| `faas.max_memory` | The Lambda function memory size in MB from the `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_MEMORY_SIZE` environment variable |
