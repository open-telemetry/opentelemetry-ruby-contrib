# OpenTelemetry::Resource::Detector::Azure

The `opentelemetry-resource-detector-azure` gem provides a Azure resource detector for OpenTelemetry.

## What is OpenTelemetry?

OpenTelemetry is an open source observability framework, providing a general-purpose API, SDK, and related tools required for the instrumentation of cloud-native software, frameworks, and libraries.

OpenTelemetry provides a single set of APIs, libraries, agents, and collector services to capture distributed traces and metrics from your application. You can analyze them using Prometheus, Jaeger, and other observability tools.

## How does this gem fit in?

The `opentelemetry-resource-detector-azure` gem provides a means of retrieving a resource for supported environments following the resource semantic conventions.

## How do I get started?

Install the gem using:

```console
gem install opentelemetry-sdk
gem install opentelemetry-resource-detector-azure
```

Or, if you use Bundler, include `opentelemetry-sdk` and `opentelemetry-resource-detector-azure` in your `Gemfile`.

```rb
require 'opentelemetry/sdk'
require 'opentelemetry/resource/detector'

OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.resource = OpenTelemetry::Resource::Detector::Azure.detect
end
```

This will populate the following resource attributes for compute running on Azure:

* `cloud.provider`
* `cloud.account.id`
* `cloud.platform`
* `cloud.region`
* `cloud.availability_zone`
* `host.id`
* `host.image.id`
* `host.name`
* `host.type`
