# Baggage Span Processor

This is an OpenTelemetry [span processor](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/sdk/#span-processor) that reads key/values stored in [Baggage](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/baggage/api/) in the starting span's parent context and adds them as attributes to the span.

Keys and values added to Baggage will appear on all subsequent child spans, not the current active span, for a trace within this service *and* will be propagated to external services via propagation headers.
If the external services also have a Baggage span processor, the keys and values will appear in those child spans as well.

⚠️ Waning ⚠️
To repeat: a consequence of adding data to Baggage is that the keys and values will appear in all outgoing HTTP headers from the application.
Do not put sensitive information in Baggage.

## How do I get started?

Install the gem using:

```console
gem install opentelemetry-processor-baggage
```

Or, if you use [bundler][bundler-home], include `opentelemetry-processor-baggage` to your `Gemfile`.

### Version Compatibility

* OpenTelemetry API v1.0+

## Usage

To install the instrumentation, add the gem to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'opentelemetry-processor-baggage'
```

Then configure the span processor to copy all baggage entries:

```ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'bundler/setup'

Bundler.require

OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  # Add the BaggageSpanProcessor to the collection of span processors and
  # copy all baggage entries
  c.add_span_processor(OpenTelemetry::Processor::Baggage::BaggageSpanProcessor.new(
    OpenTelemetry::Processor::Baggage::ALLOW_ALL_BAGGAGE_KEYS
  ))

  # Because the span processor list is no longer empty, the SDK will not use the
  # values in OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER to instantiate exporters.
  # You'll need to declare your own here in the configure block.
  #
  # These lines setup the default: a batching OTLP exporter.
  c.add_span_processor(
    # these constructors without arguments will pull config from the environment
    OpenTelemetry::SDK::Trace::Export::BatchSpanProcessor.new(
      OpenTelemetry::Exporter::OTLP::Exporter.new()
    )
  )
end
```

Alternatively, you can provide a custom baggage key predicate to select which baggage keys you want to copy.

For example, to only copy baggage entries that start with `myapp.`:

```ruby
OUR_BAGGAGE_KEY_PREFIX = 'myapp.'.freeze
OpenTelemetry::Processor::Baggage::BaggageSpanProcessor.new(
  # a constant here improves performance
  ->(baggage_key) { baggage_key.start_with?(OUR_BAGGAGE_KEY_PREFIX) }
)
```

For example, to only copy baggage entries that match `myapp.`, `myapp1.` and `myapp42.`:

```ruby
OUR_BAGGAGE_KEY_MATCHER = /\Amyapp\d*\./
OpenTelemetry::Processor::Baggage::BaggageSpanProcessor.new(
  ->(baggage_key) { OUR_BAGGAGE_KEY_MATCHER.match?(baggage_key) }
)
```
